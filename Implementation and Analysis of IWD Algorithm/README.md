Overview:

This is a R&D project based on python implementation of a swarm based optimization algorithm i.e. Intelligent Water Drop Algorithm. Along with its complexity analysis and performance evaluation. The IWD algorithm is a step in the direction to model a few actions that happen in natural rivers and then to implement them in a form of an algorithm.

You can know more about the project and the IWD algorithm in our draft anf final reports:
